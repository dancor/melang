== Pronouncing pinyin ==

1. Initial changes (pinyin lies):
- After b f m p, o -> uo.
- yu -> v. After c j q x, u -> v.
- yi to i. y -> i.
- wu to u. w -> u.
- un -> uen.
- ui -> uei.
- iu -> iou.

Now the initial is the starting consonants if any,
and the final is the rest of the letters.

2. Now each written vowel is one IPA vowel (except e in one case):
- a has 4 possibilities:
  - [a] in the finals: ai/uai.            (front low)
  - [ä] in the finals: a/ia/ua/an/uan.    (central low)
  - [ɑ] in the finals: ang/iang/uang/iao. (back low)
  - [ɛ] in the finals: ian/van. (low-mid front)
- e has 6 possibilities:
  - [Ɯʌ] in the final: e.  (high back to low-mid back)
  - [e] before an 'i'.     (high-mid front)
  - [ɤ] before 'ng'.       (high-mid back)
  - [ə] before a last 'n'. (mid central)
  - [œ] in the final: ve.  (low-mid front rounded)
  - [ɛ] in the final: ie.  (low-mid front)
- i is [ɨ] if the only vowel and after ch/sh/zh/r. (high central)
  Otherwise [i] if the first vowel. (high front)
  Otherwise [ɪ].                    (near-high near-front)
- o is [ʊ] after an 'a' or before 'ng'. (near-high near-back rounded)
  o is [ɔ] in the final: uo. (low-mid back rounded)
  Otherwise [o].             (high-mid back rounded)
- u is [u] if the first vowel; (high back rounded)
  Otherwise [ʊ].               (near-high near-back rounded)
- v is [y]. (high front rounded)

Note: o/u/v always rounded and e in the final ve; no others.
Note: After an 'a' or before 'ng', o is more like a u.
